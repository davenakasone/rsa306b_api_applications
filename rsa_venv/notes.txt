many of the python examples use different modules over the span of several years
maintian this virtual environment to ensure correct dependencies are being used
activate this virtual environment to run any python files in the project
    better yet, use Docker (did not do because not everyone knows it)

the virtual enviroment was made (already done)
    $ pip3 install virtualenv
    $ cd rsa306b_api_applications    // get into the project directory
    $ mkdir rsa_venv
    $ virtualenv rsa                 // the virtual environment

activate the venv
    $ source ./rsa/bin/activate
    $ which python                 // make sure the path is to the venv
    $ python --version             // make sure verion is 3.xx
    $ which pip                    // path and version check pip
    $ pip --version
    # your prompt should change: (rsa) ...

deactivate the venv
    $ deactivate

save the venv so others can use it
    # the venv is activated, working inside "rsa_venv"
    (rsa) unlv@unlv:~/Desktop/rsa306b_api_applications/rsa_venv$ pip freeze --local >requirments.txt
    $ cat requirments.txt    // check it, someone else can use "pip3 install requirments.txt" to make your venv

place the activation path for eash access
pip freeze before passing the venv to someone else
make sure the wheels stay on (amd64, x86-64)
