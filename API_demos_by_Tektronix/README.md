Code examples for the Tektronix RSA API used with RSA300/500/600 USB instruments. The RSA_API allows anyone to write scripts, lightweight applications, or plugins that directly control and acquire data from Tektronix USB RSA instruments without running SignalVu-PC. This repository contains complete RSA API usage examples for Python, C++, C#, Matlab, and VB.Net including configuring the RSA hardware, capturing data, and streaming IF and IQ data to disk.

To use these code examples, download and install the most recent version of the RSA API. As of this writing, the most recent version is 3.11.0047 and can be downloaded here: https://www.tek.com/model/rsa306-software/rsa-application-programming-interface-api-64-bit-windows-v3110047. Download the accompanying documentation for the API as well. The most recent version is 077-1031-04 and can be downloaded here: https://www.tek.com/spectrum-analyzer/rsa306-manual/rsa306-rsa306b-and-rsa500a-600a-0.
