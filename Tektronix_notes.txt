the api needs the .so file
	2 shared object files are required on Linux
    assuming "README_install.txt" was followed correctly,
        $ cd <your_bld_dir>
        $ make                                           (any build system)
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.      (where ever you put the 2 *.so files)
        $ ./cppLoad                                      (run your executable)
...TODO making a .bash, .sh, or .deb for this

you need the software driver (see page 6 of API .pdf)

check library
	$ sudo gcc -lpthread    // library name
don't trust system("pause") or this_thread_sleep(ms), the working thread will be locked out by a mutex
just trust the API, and don't try and fork the process it is on or do anything that involves additional threads

ensure proper hardware requirements are met before using programs
measurements are not possible without proper antenna (sensor)
data acquisition is more limited with the API, compared to the Windows-based software
C code uses C99; ensure the Makefile is sourcing correctly
Python script appears to be 2.7, try to modify code for python3 or use virtual env with 2.7

The API::
    RSA Application Programming Interface – API for 64-Bit Linux – V1.0.0014
    The RSA API is a Linux C/C++ Shared Objects that provides direct access to RSA300/500/600 devices. 
    It enables full control of the RSA and provides several forms of data and measurements to support custom applications independent of SignalVu-PC. 
    Included is the API Shared Objects for use on 64-bit Linux, tested on CentOS 7, Debian 10, and Ubuntu 18.04 systems.

    (need to make a free account with Tekronix)

Use the manufacturer's software for simple tasks::

any Windows based C/C++ code needs Linux wine if it can't be avoided
try to use the API function without the "w" or windows type ( ie "wchar" "wfopen()" ...)

see the enum for error code
a common error is #205, your USB port is not fast enough

the status light on the RSA306B should turn green if healthy

don't trust anything above -std=c++14, the newer features will not work with the RSA_API

use full scope resolution instead of namespace, more typing, but can see source
    std::cout , RSA_API::YOUR_FUN() , ...
C++ only, extern C is set in the RSA_API.h
