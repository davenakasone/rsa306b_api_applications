the api needs the .so file
	2 shared object files are required on Linux

you need the software driver (see page 6 of API .pdf)

check library
	$ sudo gcc -lpthread    // library name


ensure proper hardware requirements are met before using programs
measurements are not possible without proper antenna (sensor)
data acquisition is more limited with the API, compared to the Windows-based software
C code uses C99; ensure the Makefile is sourcing correctly
Python script appears to be 2.7, try to modify code for python3 or use virtual env with 2.7

The API::
    RSA Application Programming Interface – API for 64-Bit Linux – V1.0.0014
    The RSA API is a Linux C/C++ Shared Objects that provides direct access to RSA300/500/600 devices. 
    It enables full control of the RSA and provides several forms of data and measurements to support custom applications independent of SignalVu-PC. 
    Included is the API Shared Objects for use on 64-bit Linux, tested on CentOS 7, Debian 10, and Ubuntu 18.04 systems.
