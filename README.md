# Program Concept
- program that can interface with the Tekronix RSA306B Spectrum Analyzer
- partial discharges can be found by scanning a range of 0.5 GHz to 1.5 GHz
- examining IF, IQ, and spectrum data confirms or denys the presence of partial discharges 
- field testing allows the user to configure the software to measure signals of interest
- this program is designed to monitor power generation equipment for partial discharges
- major sections: instrument managment, data acquisition, processing, and storage
- use for any application where time domain and frequency domain data is needed [up to 6.2 GHz]
