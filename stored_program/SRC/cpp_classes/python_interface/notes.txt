the shared object should only expose pure C (or C style functions)

the header containing the interface to expose to python should only expose the intended functions
this means the source code will include the underlying class, but the python user will never be able to directly touch the classes

changes in the core classes require recompiling

ideally, the python interface will be its own module, load the shared object, and let the user mange the RSA with simple calls

compiling the shared object should extern C the exposed functions
when executed, the library path with all the shareed objects needs to be executed

maybe give the python user a python class, where try/except statements are properly placed to ensure smooth operation

seek a more definitive understanding of the research goal as the program develops
